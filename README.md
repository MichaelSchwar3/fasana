Inspired by Asana, Fasana is a full-stack web application that can be used as a Project Management tool, where users can keep track of Projects, their subsequent tasks, due dates, time lines and teams that are assigned to each project.

## Technologies

Fasana was built using a Rails backend framework, PostgreSQL for the database, and React Javascript for the front end using the Redux framework.


## Future Directions

Currently Fasana is in it's very early stages of production but is actively being updated with new features.

Please read the Wiki to see what features will be implemented!
